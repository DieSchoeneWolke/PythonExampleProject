# Example Project

This repo contains an example python project with a folder structure and files you need to develop
software professionally.

Clone the repo and run `pip install -e .[dev]` to setup the project locally.

After that, run `tox` which will run pre-commit, linting, pytest and run a Github Workflow for you.
